# Fern Asset Creator (Free)

This is the _offline documentation_ of **Fern Asset Creator (Free)**.

# Opening

To open **Fern Asset Creator**, click **Tools** in the menu, and select **Fern Asset Creator (Free)**.

This opens up the tool in a new window, that you can drag anywhere in the editor.

# Using

* Select an image for **Fern Texture**. This image should have _transparency_ as well.
* Select the wanted **Fern Type**.
* See if the preview matches your expectations.
* Click **Generate Fern** to create the _fern prefab_. Choose the location where you want the fern to be saved.

# Under the hood

* The **Fern Asset Creator** tool creates _Mesh_ and _Material_ assets.
* All generated assets are placed in the `Assets/FernAssetCreator` directory.
* You can freely move these assets around, but don't delete them! The prefab becomes unusable!

# Fern Types

* `Cross`: Two planes at a 90 degree angle.
* `Cross3`: Three planes at 60 degree angle.
* `Cross4`: Four planes at 45 degree angle.
* `Box`: A box made out of four planes.
* `Tent`: Like a box, but planes a slightly tilted.
* `V`: Like a tent, but planes a tilted at the center, not the bottom.
* `Wide Tent` / `Wide V`: The _tent_ / _V_ shape, but with a slightly greater tilt.
